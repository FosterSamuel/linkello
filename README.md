# Linkello
> Link organizer built in vanilla JS


A link-organizing service inspired by <a href='http://www.trello.com' target='_blank'>Trello.</a> It uses JavaScript for data-handling so it can run on a static host. All links will be lost upon refresh.

## Usage example

See an awesome video that you don't feel like bookmarking? Throw it in Linkello and don't close that tab. You might lose it.
